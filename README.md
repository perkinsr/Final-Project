# ECE 218 Microwave System - Final Project
Team Members: **Becky Perkins, Lilly Marletta**

## What does this System do? 
This system will implement a microwave system that correctly models the microwaves currently in our homes but with updated features, like easily changeable brightness settings. The system will take in user inputs for how long they want the microwave to run for and what wattage they want the light bulb to be at. Once the user chooses the timer amount, the display will update to show the amount of time. After the user presses what wattage they would like, the plate inside the microwave will spin automatically and the inside will light up with whatever wattage the user chose. The display outside of the microwave will start to display a message letting the user know that the microwave is running. When the timer is finished, a buzz will sound to notify the user of the completion of the timer and the light inside the microwave will turn off. Then, the display will change back to displaying the current time, alerting the user that the microwave is ready to be used again. If the microwave is in a dark room, the light sensor will notice and turn on a light inside the display so the user can continue to read the values on the display.
